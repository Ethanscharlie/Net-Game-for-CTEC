This project was made to be demoed as a network game. I wanted something the class could play while I presented the project.
After dealing with java webservers (the worst webserver api I have ever used) I decided to with pictionary because it would be uneffected
by internet latency.

The backend uses the default Java 17 HTTP Server (Which like I said, I do not recomend using).
The Frontend uses a basic html page. Websockets were not supported in Java 17, which is all I had on our school computers.
So my solution was to ping the server every 100 miliseoncds (It started tweaking out if I tried any faster) to get the game data, like
the pictionary canvas data.
